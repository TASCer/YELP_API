# YELP_API
Took the original file from here: https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-fusion#code-samples and removed Python 2 references, added get_lat_long, cleaned things up
I do/did not use the argparse modules, but kept it in as it seems useful for running the file from command line
Any insights or additions welcome
